    In 2024, we released a first short EP entitled
    <i>Damned And Doomed</i>, blending doom and cinematic horror.
    Here, the band began its exploration of the struggle for survival.

    With this EP, we closed a chapter of the band,
    while at the same time defining the universe and themes
    we wanted to explore.

    The EP is entirely DIY, based on recordings from the
    2022â€“2023 period of the band. We worked ourselves
    on the live takes in the studio, the mixing, mastering,
    and production. We also created the full artwork.
    It is available on all streaming platforms,
    and we released a CD version.
