<p>
  <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">Maanen Faces</span> is a rock band from Nantes, formed in 2021.
  Through their music, at the crossroads of
  <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">psychedelia</span>, <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">stoner</span> and <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">doom</span>,
  the band develops a dense and <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">dark universe</span>, inspired as much by Electric Wizard, Sonic Youth or Kyuss
  as by the more modern sounds of Deftones, Idles and King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard.
</p>
<p>
  Composed of <strong>Emmanuel</strong> (bass, vocals), <strong>Cl√©ment</strong> (guitar), <strong>Julien</strong> (keyboards), and <strong>Thomas</strong> (drums),
  the band explores, like Selenite envoys lost on Earth, the existential and social crises of our time.
  It is <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">mystical</span> but without god, <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">tragic</span> yet still alive.
