<p>
  <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">Maanen Faces</span> is a Nantes-based
  stoner/psych doom band formed in 2021. At the crossroads of
  <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">psychedelia</span>,
  <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">stoner rock</span> and
  <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">doom metal</span>, the quartet crafts
  a dense and dark universe, inspired as much by Electric Wizard, Sonic Youth
  and Kyuss as by modern acts such as Deftones, Idles or King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard.

  With Emmanuel (bass, vocals), Cl√©ment (guitar), Julien (keyboards) and Thomas (drums),
  Maanen Faces explores, like Lunar Envoys stranded on Earth, the existential
  and social crises of our times.
  <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">Mystical</span> but godless,
  <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">tragic</span> but still alive, the band
  is one of the emerging names to watch on the French stoner psych scene.
