    <i>A Brilliant Future</i>, released in 2025, is a sonic journey
    through a dystopian universe, where our music captures the
    turmoil of an ultra-connected world.

    Across six tracks, this new album explores social revolt,
    transhumanist drift and enslavement by artificial intelligence,
    but also suffering at work, family breakdown and the escape from death.
    A dark atmosphere, a raw energy, and an uncompromising vision
    of a future where, for us, technological progress
    is nothing more than another name for oppression.

    This album was recorded live and mixed at
    Studio Rimshot Nantes, by Justin Nicquevert (Birds Of Nazca).
    For the mastering, we chose to work with
    Justin Weis (Acid King, Amenra, Sun Crow). We created
    the entire artwork ourselves. The release includes both
    a CD version and a DIY cassette version.
