  After a first EP, <i>Damned and Doomed</i> (2024), which dealt with the inner struggle against oneâ€™s own demons in a world already doomed by the system,
  Maanen Faces released in 2025 the album <i>A Brilliant Future</i>. This record, produced between Nantes and San Francisco,
  dives into a sonic dystopia where social revolts, technological alienation and the flight from death intertwine.

  Off the beaten track, much like Magma, the band patiently builds its own universe on the fringes of the traditional scene,
  notably by organizing their festival Evil Town Party, which brings together independent bands each year in a unique atmosphere.
  On stage, the quartet unleashes a <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">raw</span> and <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">hypnotic</span> energy,
  able to turn each concert into an <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">immersive</span> experience.
  In 2024, they shared the stage with Qilin (stoner instrumental, Paris) and Slowbot(heavy/psych doom, Paris) at Supersonic (Paris).

  Maanen Faces is more than just a rock band: it is an invitation to explore the dark corners of the human soul
  through a unique sonic prism, blending power and introspection.
