  Like Selenites Emissaries stranded on Earth, Emmanuel (bass, vocals), Clément (guitar),
  Julien (keys) and Thomas (drums) explore the crises of our times.
  Following the EP <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">Damned and Doomed</span> (2024),
  the band released the album <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">A Brilliant Future</span> in 2025.
  Recorded between Nantes and San Francisco, the record dives into a sonic dystopia
  of social unrest and technological alienation.

<p>
  <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">On stage</span>,
  the project unfolds as a continuous immersive experience, a dense and
  hypnotic world where one is simply submerged in sound.
  <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">Mystical</span> but godless,
  <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">tragic</span> but still alive.
