<p>
  <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">Maanen Faces</span> is a rock band from Nantes, formed in 2021.
  Their music, at the crossroads of
  <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">psychedelia</span>, <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">doom</span> and <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">stoner</span>,
  develops a dense and <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">dark universe</span>, inspired as much by Electric Wizard, Sonic Youth or Kyuss
  as by the more modern sounds of Deftones, Idles and King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard.
</p>
<p>
  Composed of <strong>Emmanuel</strong> (bass, vocals), <strong>Clément</strong> (guitar), <strong>Julien</strong> (keyboards), and <strong>Thomas</strong> (drums),
  the band explores in their songs, like Selenite envoys lost on Earth, the existential and social crises of our time.
  It is <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">mystical</span> but without god, <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">tragic</span> yet still alive.

  After a first EP, <i>Damned and Doomed</i> (2024), which dealt with the inner struggle against one’s own demons in a world already doomed by the system,
  Maanen Faces released in 2025 the album <i>A Brilliant Future</i>. This record, produced between Nantes and San Francisco,
  dives into a sonic dystopia where social revolts, technological alienation and the flight from death intertwine.

  Off the beaten track, much like Magma, the band patiently builds its own universe and network on the fringes of the traditional scene,
  notably by organizing their festival Evil Town Party, which brings together independent bands each year in a unique atmosphere.
  On stage, the quartet unleashes a <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">raw</span> and <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">hypnotic</span> energy,
  able to turn each concert into an <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">immersive</span> experience.
  In 2024, they shared the stage with <strong>Qilin</strong>, a Parisian instrumental stoner band, and <strong>Slowbot</strong>, a heavy doom band from Paris.

<p>
  Maanen Faces is more than just a rock band: it is an invitation to explore the dark corners of the human soul
  through a unique sonic prism, blending power and introspection.
