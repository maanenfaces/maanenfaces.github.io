  <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">Maanen Faces</span> is a Nantes-based
  rock band formed in 2021. The quartet explores a
  <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">dark psych</span> universe where
  alternative rock meets the heavy undertones of stoner rock and doom metal.
  Their sound is built on a solid foundation of effect-laden bass and
  powerful drumming, layered with atmospheric synthesizers and deeply textured guitars.

  Drawing from the moody energy of <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">Black Rebel Motorcycle Club</span> and
  <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">Sonic Youth</span>, as well as the heavy echoes of
  <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">Electric Wizard</span> or
  <span class="bg-light text-dark p-1">Deftones</span>, Maanen Faces seeks to capture
  the tension of a world in flux. The band strives to translate this universe
  into an immersive experience, inviting the audience into their singular atmospheric landscape.
