  After a first EP, <b><i>Damned and Doomed</i></b> (2024), centered on the
  inner struggle against one’s demons in an already doomed world, Maanen Faces
  released the album <b><i>A Brilliant Future</i></b> in 2025. Produced between
  Nantes and San Francisco, this record dives into a sonic dystopia where
  social revolts, technological alienation and the confrontation with death intertwine.

  Remaining true to an independent mindset, the band charts its own path.
  With its festival Evil Town Party, Maanen Faces brings together an eclectic
  lineup ranging from psychedelic rock, stoner and doom to grunge, metal and jazz rock
  — with a clear will to gradually refocus the event on heavy psych and fuzz-driven sounds.

  On stage, the quartet delivers a raw, hypnotic energy, turning each concert into
  an immersive experience. In 2024, Maanen Faces shared the stage at Supersonic (Paris)
  with Qilin (instrumental stoner) and Slowbot (heavy psych doom).

  Maanen Faces is more than just another rock band: it’s an invitation to dive
  into the depths of French stoner psych doom, where fuzz-driven power, mystical
  atmospheres and introspection collide. A unique universe, bridging
  heavy psych heritage with contemporary visions.
