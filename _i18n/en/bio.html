  <span class="mf-hh mf-hw">Maanen</span>
  <span class="mf-hh mf-hw">Faces</span> is a
  <span class="mf-hh">Rock</span> band from Nantes (France) formed in 2021.
</p>
<p>
  Combining psychedelic, doom and stoner influences, the band delivers a powerful
  and dense rock. These Selenite emissaries lost on Earth explore the struggle
  for survival through their music. It's <span class="mf-hh">mystical</span>
  but without god, it's <span class="mf-hh">tragic</span> but still alive.
</p>
<p>
  After a first EP in 2024, mixing doom and cinematic horror, the
  band returns in 2025 with a new, longer, more immersive opus, where
  psychedelia flirts with the apocalypse.
